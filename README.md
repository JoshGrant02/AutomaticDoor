# Automatic Door Project
I came up with the idea for this project when my dad decided that he wanted to build a tabletop gaming room in the basement. Because I had just finished my Embedded Systems class in college, and was about to begin Embedded Systems II, I believed I would have enough experience (and that it would be a cool project) to create a button operated, motor controlled, door for the room. My dad assisted with the physical construction of the door along with some of the design, but I picked out all of the components, designed the circuitry, and wrote and tested all of the code. Below is a documentation of my experience with this project.

The first step of this project was to determine its feasibility and how I wanted the door to operate from a user standpoint.
